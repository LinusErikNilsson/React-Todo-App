My first project in React.

This is a simple Todo application in React, with the ability to create new tasks and delete the.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This Todo application is based on the tutorial availible on: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/React_todo_list_beginning
